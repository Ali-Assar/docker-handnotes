## Introduction

Welcome to the Docker Handnotes repository! These handnotes serve as concise cheat sheets tailored for backend engineers or frontend developers who want to leverage Docker without delving into the exhaustive details of the technology. Whether you're new to Docker or need quick references, these handnotes offer practical examples and explanations to streamline your development workflow.

Docker is a powerful platform for building, shipping, and running applications using containerization technology. It allows you to package your applications and their dependencies into lightweight containers that can run consistently across different environments. These handnotes aim to provide a quick reference for using Docker effectively, without overwhelming you with unnecessary details.
